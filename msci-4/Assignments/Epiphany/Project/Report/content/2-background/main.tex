\chapter{Background in topology and combinatorics}
\label{cha:background}

In this chapter, we provide some needed background in topology and combinatorics in order to understand fast constructions of the Vietoris-Rips complex, and the persistent homology algorithm and the speed-ups utilised in Ripser \cite{bauer2021ripser}.

For readers unfamiliar with topology, with a key interest in having some context before reading, see Appendix \ref{app:topology}.
