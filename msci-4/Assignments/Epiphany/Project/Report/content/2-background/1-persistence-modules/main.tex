\section{Persistence modules}

This section serves to build a single algebraic structure called a \emph{persistence module}, for which we can describe the concept of \emph{persistence}, but to do so we require tools from \emph{category theory} and \emph{module theory}. We also touch on cohomology, as it is needed for a speed-up in the persistent homology algorithm. 

We move to form a bijection between the isomorphism classes of \emph{persistence modules} of finite type over a field and the finite sets of $\mathcal P$-intervals.
