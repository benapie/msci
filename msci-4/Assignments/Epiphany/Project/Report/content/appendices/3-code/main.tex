\chapter{Source code}
\label{app:source-code}

Here we present some selected source code written for this project. We have three main libraries:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item a simplex library, implementing efficient data structures for filtered simplicial complexes; 
    \item a Vietoris-Rips construction library, implementing various skeleton and expansion methods; and
    \item a persistent homology library, implementing various speedups in the computation of persistent homology. 
\end{enumerate}
All code was written in Python 3.10.
