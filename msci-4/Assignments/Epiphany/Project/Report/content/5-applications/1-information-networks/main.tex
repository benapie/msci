\section{Information networks}

\emph{Information networks} are a popular way of capturing complex relationships across many different fields.

\begin{example}[Citation network]
    A \emph{citation network} is a directed graph $G = (V,E)$ that describes citations within a collection of documents. Each vertex $v \in V$ corresponds to a document, and there is an edge $(v, w) \in E$ if and only if document $v$ cites document $w$. Thus the out-degree of a document is the number of documents it cites, and the in-degree of a document is the number citations it has.
\end{example}

The use of persistent homology on information networks is becoming more prevalent, and this section serves to outline some of these applications, with a novel suggestions for further research.
