\begin{abstract}
This piece of work is a result of my own work except where it forms an assessment based on group project work. In the case of a group project, the work has been prepared in collaboration with other members of the group. Material from the work of others not involved in the project has been acknowledged and quotations and paraphrases suitably indicated.
