\question Let $X$ be a random variable defined as $X = \sum_{i=1}^n X_i$ where each $X_i$ is a Bernoulli random variable, and all $X_i$ are independent. Let $p_i = p(X_i = 1)$. Prove that for any $\delta \geq e^2 - 1$,
\[ p(X \geq (1 + \delta)\E[X]) \leq e^{-(\delta + 2)\E[X]}. \]

\begin{solution}
    By Chernoff's inequality, we have for any $\delta > 0$
    \[ p(X \geq (1 + \delta)\E[X]) \leq \left(\frac{e^\delta}{(1+\delta)^{(1+\delta)}}\right)^{\E[X]}. \]
    As
    \[ \frac{e^\delta}{(1+\delta)^{(1+\delta)}} \geq 1 \]
    and $E[X] \geq 0$, we move to upper bound
    \[ \frac{e^\delta}{(1+\delta)^{(1+\delta)}}. \]
    Let $\delta \geq e^2 - 1$, then $1 + \delta \geq e^2$ and so we have
    \[ \frac{e^\delta}{(1+\delta)^{(1+\delta)}} \leq \frac{e^\delta}{e^{2(1+\delta)}} = e^{-2(\delta + 1)}, \]
    giving the desired result.

\question Consider the following probabilistic process. You have a collection of $n$ many ``bins'', and also $n$ many ``balls''. Assume that both are numbered $1,2, \ldots, n$. The balls are thrown into the bins independently and uniformly at random, that is, for each ball, every bin has the same probability of being chosen for the ball.

Formally prove that with high probability (of the form $1 - 1/n^c$ for some constant $c \in \R_{\geq 1}$) the maximum number of balls in any bin is $O(\log n)$.
