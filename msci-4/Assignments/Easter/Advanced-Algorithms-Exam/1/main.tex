\question Let $G = (V,E)$ be a graph. Recall that a function $c: V \to \{1,\ldots, k\}$ is a $k$-colouring if $c(u) \neq c(v)$ for every pair of adjacent vertices $u$ and $v$. For $1 \leq i \leq k$, the set $C_i = \{i \in V: c(u) = i\}$ is called a \emph{colour set} of $c$. For a pair $i,j$ with $1 \leq i < j \leq k$, let $G[i,j]$ denote the subgraph of $G$ induced by the set $C_i \cup C_j$. 

We say that a $k$-colouring $c$ of $G$ is \emph{safe} if for every pair $i,j$ with $i \neq j$, the subgraph $G[i,j]$ has maximum degree at most $3$. The \emph{safety number} of $G$ is the smallest number $k$ such that $G$ has a safe $k$-colouring.

Let \textsc{Safety Number} be the problem of deciding if a given graph $G$ has safety number at most $k$ for some given integer $k$. If $k$ is fixed (so if $k$ is not part of the input), then we denote the problem as \textsc{$k$-Safety Number}.
