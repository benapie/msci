\part[2] Prove that the safety number of a graph $G$ is at most $\lvert V(G) \rvert$. 

\begin{solution}
    Consider the trivial colouring in which each vertex is given a distinct colour. Then the induced subgraph by every colour set is either $2P_1$ or $P_2$ (assuming $G$ is simple), which has degree at most $1$.
\end{solution}
