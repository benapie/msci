\part[5] Let $\Pi$ be some $\NP$-complete graph problem. Suppose that we can solve $\Pi$ in polynomial time for $P_6$-free graphs. Does this mean that we can solve $\Pi$ in polynomial time for $2P_3$-free graphs? Justify your answer.

\begin{solution}
    If we found that the class of $2P_3$-free graphs $\mathcal G_1$ are a subclass of the class of $P_6$-free graphs $\mathcal G_2$ (that is, $\mathcal G_1 \subset \mathcal G_2$), then we could solve $\Pi$ in polynomial restricted to $\mathcal G_1$. But we do not have this: $P_6$ is a graph that is $2P_3$-free, but it is certainly not $P_6$-free. Thus, the answer is no.
