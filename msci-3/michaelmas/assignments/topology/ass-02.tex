	\question
		Decide which of the following subsets of $\mathcal P(X)$,
		where $X = \left\{ 1,2,4 \right\}$, defines a topology.
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item $
				\tau_1 = \{
					\varnothing,
					\left\{ 1 \right\},
					\left\{ 1, 2 \right\},
					\left\{ 1, 2, 4 \right\}
				\}
			$;

			\item $
				\tau_2 = \{
					\varnothing,
					\left\{ 1 \right\},
					\left\{ 2 \right\},
					\left\{ 1, 2 \right\},
					\left\{ 1, 2, 4 \right\}
				\}
			$;

			\item $
				\tau_3 = \{
					\varnothing,
					\left\{ 1 \right\},
					\left\{ 4 \right\},
					\left\{ 1, 2, 4 \right\}
				\}
			$;

			\item $
				\tau_4 = \{
					\varnothing,
					\left\{ 2 \right\},
					\left\{ 4 \right\},
					\left\{ 2, 4 \right\},
					\left\{ 1, 2, 4 \right\}
				\}
			$;

			\item $
				\tau_5 = \{
					\varnothing,
					\left\{ 2, 4 \right\},
					\left\{ 1, 2, 4 \right\}
				\}
			$;

			\item $
				\tau_6 = \{
					\varnothing,
					\left\{ 2 \right\},
					\left\{ 1, 2, 4 \right\}
				\}
			$; and

			\item $
				\tau_7 = \{
					\varnothing,
					\left\{ 1 \right\},
					\left\{ 2 \right\},
					\left\{ 2, 4 \right\},
					\left\{ 1, 2, 4 \right\}
				\}
			$.
		\end{enumerate}
	\begin{solution}
		All collections satisfy $X, \varnothing \in \tau$.
		As $\left\{ 1 \right\}, \left\{ 4 \right\} \in \tau_3$
		but $\left\{ 1,4 \right\} \not\in \tau_3$, $\tau_3$ is not a
		topology.
		Similarly, as $\left\{ 1 \right\}, \left\{ 2 \right\} \in \tau_7$
		but $\left\{ 1, 2 \right\} \not\in \tau_7$, $\tau_7$ is also
		not a topology.
		All other collections are closed under union and intersection,
		hence they define topologies.
	\end{solution}
		
	\question
		Let $X$ be a finite set, and $\tau$ a topology on $X$.
		Assume that $(X, \tau)$ is a Hausdorff space.
		Show that $\tau$ is the discrete topology
		(in other words,
		show that every subset of $X$ is open).
	\begin{solution}
		We claim that all singleton sets of $X$ are open.
		Let $x, y_1, \ldots, y_n \in X$ be all the points in $X$.
		Then as $X$ is Hausdorff there exists the open sets
		$U_1, \ldots, U_n, V_1, \ldots, V_n$ such that for all
		$i \in \left\{ 1, \ldots, n \right\}$ we have
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item $x \in U_i$;
			\item $y_i \in V_i$; and
			\item $U_i \cap V_i = \varnothing$.
		\end{enumerate}
		Now let $U = \bigcup_{i \in {1,\ldots,n}} U_i$.
		Clearly $y_i \not\in U$ for all $i \in {1, \ldots, n}$.
		Therefore $U = \left\{ x \right\}$ and $U$ is open
		as an arbitrary union of open sets is open.
		As $x$ was chosen arbitrarily, all singleton sets are open.
		Therefore, the union of any combination of singleton sets are open.
		Hence $\tau = \mathcal P(X)$.
	\end{solution}
	

	\question
		Let $X$ be a topological space, 
		and let $Y \subset X$ be a subspace of $X$
		(so $Y$ is given the subspace topology).
		Let $A \subset Y$.
		If $A$ is closed in $Y$, and if $Y$ is closed in $X$,
		show that $A$ is closed in $X$.

	\begin{solution}
		$A$ is closed in $Y$,
		so $Y \setminus  A$ is open with $\tau_A$
		and as $\tau_A \subset \tau$, $Y \setminus A$ is
		also open with $\tau$.
		Similarly as $Y$ is closed in $X$, 
		$X \setminus Y$ is open with $\tau$.
		Note that \[
			X \setminus A = (X \setminus Y) \cup (Y \setminus A)
		\]
		so $X \setminus A$ is a union of two open sets (with $\tau$);
		therefore, $X \setminus A$ is open with $\tau$.
		We conclude that $A$ is closed $X$.
	\end{solution}
