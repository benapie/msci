\begin{questions}
	\question
	Find how many solutions $(a,b)$ there are with (i) $a,b \in \Z$ and
	(ii) $a,b \in \N$ to the following equation,
	\[
		a^2 + b^2 = 2^3 \times 7^4 \times 37^5 \times 41.
	\]
	
	\question
	Let $R = \Z[\sqrt{-3}]$ and $J = (2, 1 + \sqrt{-3})_R$.
	Show that
	\begin{parts}
		\part
		$J$ is a prime ideal in $R$.

		\part
		$J^2 = (2)_RJ$, but $J \neq (2)_R$.

		\part
		How does this compare with what we have seen in the lectures that all
		non-zero prime ideals in a ring of integers of a number field are
		invertible?
	\end{parts}

	\question
	Let $R = \mathcal O_J$ for some number field $K$.
	Prove Lemma 36 from the lecture, that is, show the following.

	Let $\mathfrak p$ be any proper non-zero ideal in the ring $R$.
	The following statements are equivalent:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $\mathfrak p$ is irreducible;
		\item $\mathfrak p$ is prime (= maximal);
		\item $\mathfrak p \mid IJ \implies 
			\mathfrak p \mid I \;\text{or}\; \mathfrak p \mid J$.
	\end{enumerate}

	Note: for this question one cannot use Theorem 37 which was proved after
	Lemma 36.
