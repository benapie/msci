\begin{questions}
	\question Let $E \subset \R$ and let $E'$ be the set of accumulation points
	of $E$.
	The set $E$ is called \emph{isolated} if $E \cap E' = \varnothing$.
	Prove that every isolated set of real numbers is countable.

	\question What are the sets of real numbers that are both open and closed?

	\question A continuous function $\varphi$ on $[a,b]$ is called 
	\emph{piecewise linear} if there is a partition 
	$a = x_0 < x_1 < \ldots < x_n = b$ of $[a,b]$ for which $\varphi$ is linear
	on each interval $[x_i, x_{i+1}]$.
	Let $f$ be a continuous function on $[a,b]$ and $\varepsilon$ be a positive
	number.
	Show that there is a piecewise linear function $\varphi$ on $[a,b]$ with
	$\left\lvert f(x) - \varphi(x) \right\rvert < \varepsilon$ for all
	$x \in [a,b]$.
