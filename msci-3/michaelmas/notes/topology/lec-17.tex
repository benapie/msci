\begin{definition}[Path-connected]
	A \emph{path} in a topological space $X$ is a continuous function
	$\gamma: [0,1] \to X$.
	We say $\gamma$ is a path from $\gamma(0)$ to $\gamma(1)$.
	$X$ is said to be \emph{path-connected} if for every $x, y \in X$
	there is a path $\gamma$ such that $\gamma(0) = x$ and $\gamma(1) = y$.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[]
	A path-connected space is connected.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
	Let $X$ be path-connected and let $p,q \in X$.
	Len $\gamma_q$ be a path from $p$ to $q$.
	$\gamma_q([0,1])$ is connected.
	For every $q,q' \in X$,
	\[
		p \in \gamma_q([0,1]) \cup \gamma_{q'}([0,1])
	\]
	so they are not disjoint.
	As
	\[
		X
		= \bigcup_{q \in X} \left\{
			q
		\right\}
		= \bigcup_{q \in X} \left\{
			\gamma(1)
		\right\}
		\subset \bigcup_{q \in X} \gamma([0,1])
		\subset X;
	\]
	thus, $X$ is connected.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}[]
	Let \[
		Z = \left\{
			\left( 
				x, \sin\left( 
					\frac{\pi}x 
				\right) 
			\right) \in \R^2 : x \in (0,1]
		\right\}.
	\]
	Observe that $Z$ is path-connected, so $Z$ is connected and so
	$\overline Z$ is connected.
	Now $\overline Z = Z \cup \left\{
		(0,y): y \in [0,1]
	\right\}A$, but this is \emph{not} path connected.
	Suppose it is.
	Let $\gamma$ be a path from $(0,1)$ to $(1, \sin 1)$.
	Pick $a_1 \in [0,1]$ such that $(\pi_x \circ \gamma)(a_1) = \frac2\pi$
	which exists by the intermediate value theorem.
	Now let $a_2 \in (0, a_1)$ such that
	$(\pi_x \circ \gamma)(a_2) = \frac{2\pi}2$ which again we know exists
	by the intermediate value theorem.
	We repeat this to obtain $\left\{
		a_n
	\right\}$ where $a_1 > a_2 > \ldots$ and $a_n \in [0,1]$
	such that $(\pi_x \circ \gamma)(a_n) = \frac2{n\pi}$.
	Let $a = \lim_{n \to \infty} a_n$.
	$\gamma$ and $\pi_y$ are continuous, so
	$(\pi_y \circ \gamma)(a_n) \to (\pi_y \circ \gamma)(a)$
	as $n \to \infty$.
	But \[
		(\pi_y \circ \gamma)(a_n)
		= \sin\left( 
			\frac{1}{\left( 
				\frac{2}{n\pi} 
			\right)}
		\right)
		= \sin\left( 
			\frac{n\pi}{2} 
		\right)
	\]
	which does not converge.
\end{example}
