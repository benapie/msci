	\question Suppose you are on a game show and you have been given the choice
	of three doors.
	Behind one door is a car and behind the others: goats.
	You pick a door, say number 1, and the host (who knows what is behind the
	doors) opens another door, say number 3, which has a goat.
	He then says to you: \emph{"Do you want to pick door number 2?"}
	Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?
