\question Suppose the information content of a packet is the bit pattern $1110\,0110\,1001\,1101$ and an even parity scheme is being used.
What would the value of the field containing the parity bits be for the case of a two-dimensional parity scheme?
Your answer should be such that the total number of parity bits used is minimised.

\question Show that two-dimensional parity checks can correct and detect a single bit error. 
Show (give an example of) a double-bit error that can be detected but not corrected.

\question Suppose the information portion of a packet contains 10 bytes consisting of the 8-bit unsigned binary ASCII representation of string ``Networking''.
Compute the Internet checksum for this data.

\question Consider the CRC divisor $10011$, and suppose that $D$ has the value of $1010101010$. What is the value of the remainder $R$ that should be transmitted along with $D$?
