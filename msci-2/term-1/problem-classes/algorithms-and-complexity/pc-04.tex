\question Give a top-down with memoization algorithm for the longest common subsequence problem. 
The algorithm should only retyrn the length of an LCS, it need not keep track of the actual subsequence. 
In other words, it only uses the table $c$, but not the table $b$.

\question A \emph{palidrome} is a nonempty string that reads the same forward and backward, such as \texttt{racecar} or \texttt{rotor}. 
The longest palindrome subsequence (LPS) problem asks for a longest palindrome subsequence of a given sequence.
\begin{parts}
    \part Show how to use the LCS algorithm to solve the LPS problem.

    \part Give the optimal substructure for the LPS problem. (No need to prove it formally)
    
    \part Give the recursion for the length of an LPS.

    \part Give a bottom-up algorithm to determine an LPS.

    \part Give an algorithm to print out the LPS.
\end{parts}

\question A matching $M$ in a graph $G$ is \emph{maximal} if there is no edge $e \in E(G) \setminus M$ such that $M \cup \{e\}$ is a matching.
Prove that every maximum matching is maximal, 
but that the reverse may not be necessarily true.

\question Give a $2$-approximation algorithm for the \textsc{Matching} problem on graphs with $m$ edges that runs in $O(m)$ time. 
That is, give an $O(m)$-time algorithm that for a given $m$-vertex graph $G$ computes a matching $M$ of $G$ such that $v(G) \leq 2 \lvert M \rvert$.
