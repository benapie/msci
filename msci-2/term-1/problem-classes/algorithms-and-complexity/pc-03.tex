\question What is the optimal substructure property for rod cutting?

\question What is the recursion for the solution?

\question Modify the top-down with memoization algorithm and the bottom-up algorithm so as to return the optimal cutting points (see lecture notes for context).

\question Give an algorithm to reconstruct the solution. Does it matter whether we use memoization or bottom up?

\question Give a top-down with memoization algorithm for the matrix chain multiplication problem.
The algorithm should only give the number of multiplications, so it does not need to keep track of where we place the parentheses.
