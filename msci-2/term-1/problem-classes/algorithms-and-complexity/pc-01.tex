\question Solve the following fractional knapsack problem using the greedy algorithm we saw in Lecture 3: $W = 100$, $n = 5$ and
\begin{align*}
    v_1 &= 25,  & w_1 &= 5  \\
    v_2 &= 120, & w_2 &= 60 \\
    v_3 &= 50,  & w_3 &= 50 \\
    v_4 &= 25,  & w_4 &= 50 \\
    v_5 &= 60,  & w_5 &= 40.
\end{align*}

\question Redo this example, but this time for the $0-1$ knapsack problem. What is the optimal solution in this case?

\question Using the \textsc{PARTITION*} algorithm, modify the greedy algorithm for fractional knapsack to avoid sorting the list of ratios.
For simplicity, you may assume that all value per weight ratios $r_i$ are distinct.

\begin{algorithm}
    \caption{PARTITION*}
    \begin{algorithmic}[1]
        \Procedure{PARTITION*}{$A, q$}
            \State exchange $A[q] \leftrightarrow A[n]$
            \State $x \gets A[n]$
            \State $k \gets 0$
            \For{$j \gets 1$ to $n - 1$}
                \If{$A[j] \leq x$}
                    \State $k \gets k + 1$
                    \State exchange $A[k] \leftrightarrow A[j]$
                \EndIf
            \EndFor
            \State exchange $A[k _ 1] \leftrightarrow A[n]$
            \State \Return $k + 1$
        \EndProcedure
    \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\question Consider another kind of greedy algorithm for the (fractional or $0-1$) knapsack: (we assume that no item weighs more than $W$)
\begin{enumerate}
    \item sort the item according to their value $v_i$ in non-increasing order; then
    \item take as much of the most valuable item as possible, then as much of the second most valuable item as possible, and so on until the knapsack is full.
\end{enumerate}
Use this algorithm for the example above (both for fractional and $0-1$). What is its running time?

\question Denote the total value obtained by this modified greedy algorithm as $M$, and the optimal value as $V$. Prove the following:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item for any fractional knapsack problem on $n$ items, $V \leq nM$; and
    \item conversely, for any $n \geq 2$ and any $\varepsilon > 0$, there is a fractional knapsack problem on $n$ items such that $V > nM - \varepsilon$.
\end{enumerate}
