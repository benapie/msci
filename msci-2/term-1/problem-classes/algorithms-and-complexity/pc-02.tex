\question Give a polynomial-time algorithm based on divide and conquer for solving \textsc{Independent Set} on cographs. 
Justify why this is a divide-and-conquer algorithm.

\question Let $G$ be a graph. Give a polynomial-time algorithm for deciding if $G$ is a cograph.
State (and justify) the asymptotic running time of your algorithm explicitly.

\question Use Strassen's algorithm to compute the product $C = AB$ where
\[
    A = 
    \begin{pmatrix}
        3 & -1 \\
        2 & 4  \\
    \end{pmatrix},
    \qquad
    B =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        2  & 2 \\
        -3 & 0 \\
    \end{pmatrix}
    .
\]

\question Modify Strassen's algorithm to multiply $n \times n$ matrices when $n$ is not a power of two.
Show that the running time is still $\Theta(n^{\log_27})$.
