\begin{proposition}[]
    Let $\bm a$ be a critical point of a differentiable function $f$
    and let
    $H_{ij} = \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_i \partial x_j}$
    be the Hessian matrix there.
    Then
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item if $H$ is (postive/negative) definite, 
            then $\bm a$ is a strict local (minimum/maximum) of $f$;

        \item if $H$ is indefinite then $\bm a$ is neither
            a local minimum nor a local maximum:
            it is a \emph{saddle point}; and
            
        \item in all other cases $H$ is positive or negative semi-definite,
            the behaviour depends on higher order terms and can be subtle.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
