\section{Maxima and minima}
\lecture{18}{21/11}

Let $f: X \to \R$ where $X \subset \R^n$. $X$ may not be open, but we can define an important open subset of $X$ called the \emph{interior}.

\begin{definition}[Interior]
    A point $\bm x \in X$ is in the interior of $X$ (denoted $\bm x \in \inte{X}$) if there exists $\delta > 0$ such that 
    \[ B_\delta(\bm x) \subset X. \]
\end{definition}

Unless otherwise staated, we suppose $f$ is continuously differentiable on the interior of a set $X$.

\begin{definition}[Maximum and minimum points]
    Let $X \subset \R^n$ and $f: X \to \R$, then
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\bm a \in X$ is a \textbf{global maximum} (or \textbf{absolute maximum}) for $f$ if
            \[ f(\bm a) \geq f(\bm x) \]
            for all $\bm x \in X$;
        \item $\bm a \in X$ is a \textbf{global minimum} (or \textbf{absolute minimum}) for $f$ if
            \[ f(\bm a) \leq f(\bm x) \]
            for all $\bm x \in X$;
        \item $\bm a \in X$ is a \textbf{strict global maximum} if
            \[ f(\bm a) > f(\bm x) \]
            for all $\bm x \in X$ and the same for strict global minimum; and
        \item $\bm a \in X$ is a \textbf{local maximum} if $\bm a \in \inte{f}$ and there exists a neighbour $N$ such that $\bm a \in N$ and 
            \[ f(\bm a) \geq f(\bm x) \]
            for all $\bm x \in N$, and equivalent definition exists for a local minimum.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[External]
    An \textbf{external point} is a (maybe local) minimum or maximum point.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[]
    If $f$ is differentiable at $\bm a$ and $\nabla f(\bm a) \neq 0$ then $\bm a$ is \emph{not} an external point.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
    Let $\bm x(t)$ be some curve going through $\bm a$ such that $\bm x(\bm a) = \bm 0$. 
    We define the tangent such that
    \[ \frac{d\bm x}{dt} \cdot \nabla f \neq 0 \]
    at $\bm a$.
    We set $F(t) = f(\bm x(t))$ then
    \[ \frac{dF}{dt} \Bigr|_{t = 0} = \frac{d\bm x}{dt} \cdot \nabla f \neq 0 \]
    and so this is not an external point. %might need more work todo
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}[]
    Local extrema of differentiable functions occur at critical points.
\end{proposition}

\begin{remark}
    \emph{Warning}, it is not true to say that all critical points are local extreme.
\end{remark}
