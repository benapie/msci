We previously defined $\Q[x]/(x^3+1)$, now we will make the idea of quotients of polynomial rings more rigorous.

\begin{theorem}[Quotients of polynomial rings]
    Let $F$ be a field and $f(x) \in F[x]$ where $\deg f \geq 0$. Then
    \[ F[x] / (f(x)) = \{ \overline{a_0 + a_1 x + \ldots + a_{d - 1}x^{d - 1}} : a_i \in F \}. \]
    Moreover, all above cosets are \emph{distinct}.
\end{theorem}
