\section{Definitions}

\emph{Non-local means} is an algorithm in image processing
which revolves around the principal of replacing the colour of a pixel with an average
of the colours of similar pixels in order to denoise \cite{buades2005non}.

\begin{definition}[Discrete non-local means]
    \label{def:non-local-means}
    Let $\Omega$ be the area of an image and $p, q \in \Omega$ be points.
    Then
    \[ u(p) = \frac1{C(p)} \sum_{q \in \Omega}v(q) f(p, q) \]
    where
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $u(p)$ gives the filtered value
            (according to the non-local means algorithm) at point $p$;
        \item $v(q)$ gives the unfiltered value of the image at point $q$;
        \item $f: \Omega \times \Omega \to \R$ is a \emph{weighting function}; and
        \item $C(p)$ is a \emph{normalising factor} given by
            \[ C(p) = \sum_{q \in \Omega} f(p, q). \]
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

Discussion on picking $f$ will come later in the document, first we will discuss implementation techniques.
