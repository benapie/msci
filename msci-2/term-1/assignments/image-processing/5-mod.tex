\section{Modifications}

As mentioned in the parameters section, 
it has been shown that choosing some parameters \emph{locally} (namely $h$) 
can lead to better performance in the non-local means filter \cite{duval2010parameter}.

Another modification to the non-local means algorithm is changing the 
weighting function. 
The original non-local means functions uses the L2 norm (Euclidean norm);
however, research has shown that the L3 norm to be more effective as the
difference between two neighbourhoods as the differences become more pronounced 
\cite{wahid2015modified}.

Utilising \emph{summed square image} and \emph{fast Fourier transforms},
the non-local means algorithm was able to run (up to) fifty times more efficiently
with denoising results that were similar to the original algorithm in MSE \cite{wang2006fast}.
