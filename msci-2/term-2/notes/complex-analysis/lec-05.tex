\begin{lemma}[]
    Let $D$ be a starlike domain and $f: D \to \C$
    be a continuous function.
    If
    \[
        \int_{\partial \triangle} f(z) \,dz = 0
    \]
    for all $\triangle \subset D$
    then there exists a holomorphic function 
    $F: D \to \C$
    such that
    \[
        F'(z) = f(z)
    \]
    for all $z \in D$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    The proof for this lemma follows the same reasoning
    as the proof for the converse to the fundamental theorem
    of calculus.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Cauchy's theorem]
    Let $f$ be continuous on the domain $D$
    and assume $f$ is holomorphic on $D$,
    except at a finite set of points.
    Then we have 
    \[
        \int_{\partial \triangle} f(z) \, dz = 0
    \]
    for any $\triangle \in D$
    and so there exists an holomorphic anti-derivative;
    so by the fundamental theorem of calculus we have
    \[
        \int_\gamma f(z) \,dz = \int_\gamma F'(z) \,dz = 0
    \]
    for any closed contour.
\end{proof}
