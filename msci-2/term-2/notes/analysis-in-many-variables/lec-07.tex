\paragraph{Method 2}

We can express a surface $S$ as a level set, that is $f(x, y, z) = c$
for some constant $c$.
Then $\nabla f$ is a normal vector to $S$ and
\[
    \hat{\bm n} = \frac{\nabla f}{\norm{\nabla f}}
\]
is a unit normal.
By the implicit function theorem, $S$ can be written as 
$z = g(x, y)$
for some function $g$
(as long as $\frac{\partial f}{\partial z} \neq 0 \in S$).
So
\[
    f(x, y, g(x,y)) = c.
\]
Hence we can use $(x,y)$ to parametrise $S$ as
\[
    \bm x(x, y) = (x, y, g(x, y)).
\]
Then we have
\[
    \frac{\partial \bm x}{\partial x} \times \frac{\partial \bm x}{\partial y}
    = (1, 0, g_x) \times (0, 1, g_y) = -\bm e_1 g_x - \bm e_2 g_y + \bm e_3.
\]
Additionally, from last term we saw that
\begin{align*}
    g_x &= \frac{
        \left(
            - \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} 
        \right)}{
        \left(
            \frac{\partial f}{\partial z}
        \right)} &
    g_y &= \frac{
        \left(
            - \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} 
        \right)}{
        \left(
            \frac{\partial f}{\partial z}
        \right)} 
\end{align*}
hence
\[
    \frac{\partial \bm x}{\partial x} \times \frac{\partial \bm x}{\partial y}
    = \bm e_1 \frac{
            \left(
                \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}
            \right)}{
            \left(
                \frac{\partial f}{\partial z}
            \right)}
    + \bm e_2 \frac{
            \left(
                \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}
            \right)}{
            \left(
                \frac{\partial f}{\partial z}
            \right)}
    + \bm e_3
    = \frac{\nabla f}{\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}\right)}
    = \frac{\nabla f}{\bm e_3 \cdot \nabla f}.
\]
Now, using method 1 we get
\[
    \int_S \bm F \cdot d \bm A 
    = \int_A \frac{\bm F \cdot \nabla F}{\bm e_3 \cdot \nabla F} \,dx\,dy
\]
where $A$ is the projection of $S$ to the $x$-$y$ plane.
