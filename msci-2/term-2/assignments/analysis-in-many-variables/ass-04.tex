\question Consider the vector field
\[
    \bm F = y\bm e_1 + (z-x)\bm e_2 + (x^3 + y)\bm e_3.
\]
Evaluate
\[
    \int_S (\nabla \times \bm F) \cdot d\bm A
\]
explicitly, where
\begin{parts}
    \part $S$ is the disk $x^2 + y^2 \leq 4$, $z = 1$; and
    \part $S$ is the surface of a paraboloid $x^2 + y^2 = 5 - z$ above the plane $z = 1$.
\end{parts}
Verify that each of these agrees with Stokes' theorem by considering the integral
of $\bm F$ around each bounding contour.

\question Verify Stokes' theorem,
\[
    \oint_C \bm F \cdot d\bm x = \int_S \nabla \times \bm F \cdot d\bm A
\]
when $S$ is the part of the surface of the sphere $x^2 + y^2 + (z - 1)^2 = r^2$
above the plane $z = 0$, and $\bm F(x,y,z) = (z,x,y)$.
Assume that $r > 1$ so that the boundary $C$ of $S$ is non-empty.
(Hint: parametrise $S$ with spherical coordinates centered on the point $(0,0,1)$.)
