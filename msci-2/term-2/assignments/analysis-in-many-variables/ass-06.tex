\question If $\bm F = x \bm e_1 + y \bm e_2$, calculate
\[
    \int_S \bm F \cdot d\bm A
\]
where $S$ is the part of the surface $z = 9 - x^2 - y^2$ that is
above the $x,y$ plane, by applying the divergence theorem to the volume
bounded by the surface and the piece it cuts out of the $x,y$ plane.
Hint: what is $\bm F \cdot d\bm A$ \emph{on} the $x,y$ plane?

\question Evaluate
\[
    \int_S \bm B(\bm x) \cdot d\bm A
\]
where
\[
    \bm B(\bm x) = (8x + \alpha y - z) \bm e_1 
    + (x + 2y + \beta z) \bm e_2
    + (\gamma x + y - z) \bm e_3
\]
and $S$ is the surface of the sphere having centre at $(\alpha, \beta, \gamma)$
and radius $\gamma$, where $\alpha, \beta \in \R$ and 
$\gamma$ is an arbitrary positive real number.
