\question Use method 2 from lectures to compute the surface integral
\[
    \int_S \bm F \cdot d\bm A
\]
of the vector field 
$\bm F = (3x^2, -2yx, 8)$ 
over the surface given by the plane
$z = 2x - y$ 
with
$0 \leq x \leq 2$, $0 \leq y \leq 2$.

\question For a simple closed curve $C$ in the $(x,y)$-plane,
show by Green's theorem that the area enclosed in $A$ is
\[
    A = \frac12 \oint_C (x\,dy - y\, dx).
\]

\question Evaluate 
$\oint\bm F \cdot d\bm x$
around the circle
$x^2 + y^2 + 2x = 0$,
where $\bm F = y\bm e_1 - x\bm e_2$,
both directly and by using Green's theorem in the plane.
