\question Calculate the double integral
\[
    \int\int_A \left(\lvert x \rvert + \lvert y \rvert\right) \,dx\,dy
\]
where $\bm A$ is the region defined by $\lvert x \rvert + \lvert y \rvert \leq 1$.

\question Compute the iterated integral
\[
    \int_0^1 \int_0^1 \left( \frac{x^2 - y^2}{(x^2 + y^2)^2} \right) \,dy\,dx.
\]
Now reverse the order of integrations and re-evaluate.
Why doesn't your answer contradict Fubini's theorem?
(Hints: for the first integral, with respect to $y$,
it might help to aim at something that can be integrated by parts
using $\frac{d}{dy}\left(\frac{1}{x^2+y^2}\right)=-\frac{2y}{(x^2+y^2)^2}$;
and in answering to the last part of the question, the fact that 
$\int_0^1\left\lvert\frac{x^2-y^2}{(x^2+y^2)^2}\right\rvert\,dy \geq
    \int_0^x\left(\frac{x^2-y^2}{(x^2+y^2)^2}\right)\,dy$
could be useful.)

\question A function $f(x, y)$ is defined by
\[
    f(x,y)=
    \begin{cases}
        1 & -1 < x-y < 0 \\
        -1 & 0 < x-y < 1 \\
        0 & \text{otherwise}.
    \end{cases}
\]
Compute 
$\int_0^\infty \left(\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x,y) \,dx\right)\,dy$
and also
$\int_{-\infty}^\infty \left(\int_0^\infty f(x, y)\,dy\right)\,dx$
(for the second case it might help to draw a picture).
Comment on your two answers - why does Fubini fail?
